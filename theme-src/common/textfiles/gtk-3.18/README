Summary
-------

* Do not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files
* To be able to use the latest/adequate version of sass, install sassc
* The configure script will detect whether or not you have sassc installed;
  if you do, it will regenerate the CSS every time you modify the SCSS files.

SCSS Structure
----------------------

CinnXP is a complex theme, so to keep it maintainable it's written and
processed in SASS. The generated CSS is then transformed into a gresource file
during gtk build and used at runtime in a non-legible or editable form.

Each flavor is broken down into common and flavor-specific scss files. Note
that some flavor-specific files are shared by multiple themes (but not all).
Common files by definition are shared by all flavors. This is how we can have
only a few files while having many different variants (think modules)

Common:

_colors_common.scss  - global color definitions shared by each flavor.

_colors-public.scss  - SCSS colors exported through gtk to allow for 3rd party
                       apps color mixing.

_common.scss         - the backbone for the widget code

_drawing_common.scss - drawing helper mixings/functions to allow easier
                       definition of widget drawing under specific context.

_apps.scss           - random apps that don't sit well in common

_nemo.scss           - the nemo app

_screensaver.scss    - the cinnamon screensaver

Flavor-specific:

_colors.scss         - global color definitions specific for each flavor
                     
_drawing_<X>.scss    - drawing functions for "X"

You can read about SASS at http://sass-lang.com/documentation/. Once you make
your changes to the _common.scss file, GTK+ will rebuild the CSS files.
