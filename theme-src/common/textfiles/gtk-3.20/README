Summary
-------

* Do not edit the CSS directly, edit the source SCSS files and process them with SASS (run 
  `/.parse-sass.sh` when you have the required sofwtare installed, as described below)
* To be able to use the lates/adequate version of sass, install ruby, gem, sass & bundle.

How to tweak the theme
----------------------

Each flavor of CinnXP needs its own cinnamon.css file, but these only vary by about 50 lines (maybe)

The SCSS mechanism allows all of these flavors to be represented with a few files, simplifying testing

Also, SCSS is the future...and thus 10000000x cooler than the "old school way"

The following files are necessary for constructing the cinnamon.css file

cinnamon.scss       - the "root" file, contains some important variables

_colors.scss        - global color definitions

_common.scss        - the backbone for the cinnamon.css file
                      
You can read about SASS at http://sass-lang.com/documentation/. Once you make your changes to the
_common.scss file, you can either run the ./parse-sass.sh script or keep SASS watching for changes as you
edit. This is done by running `bundle exec sass --watch --sourcemap=none .` If sass is out of date, or is
missing, you can install it with `bundle install`.

Also note, this mechanism for creating the cinnamon.css file is mostly for testing purposes, the top-level
script in CinnXP will create the entire theme in one stroke
